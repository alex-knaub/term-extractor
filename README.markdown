= The Trampoline Systems term extractor

The term extractor is a library for taking natural text and extracting a
set of terms from it which make sense without additional context. For example, feeding it the following text from my home page:

  Hi. I’m David.

  I’m also various other things. By training I’m a mathematician, but I seem to have drifted away from that and become a programmer, currently working on natural language processing and social analytic software at Trampoline Systems.

  This site is my public face on the internet. It contains my blog, my OpenID and anything else I want to share with the world. 

We get the following terms:

  David
  training
  mathematician
  programmer
  natural language processing
  social analytic software
  Trampoline Systems
  site
  public face
  public face on the internet
  internet
  blog
  world
 
No attempt is made to assign meaning to the terms: They're not guaranteed to represent the content of the document. They're just intended to be coherent snippets of text which you can reuse in a broader context.

One limitation of this is that it doesn't necessarily extract all reasonable terms. For example "natural language" is a reasonable term for this text which is not included in this. The way we use the term extractor at trampoline is to build a vocabulary of terms we consider interesting and then performing literal string searching for this term - this allows us to be selective in what terms we generate and permissive in looking for matches for them.
